# CZ2002 : Object Oriented Design and Programming

## Brief Description
I have learnt **object oriented programming(OOP)** in both **Java and C++**. The coursework includes a group project where our group has accomplished building a functional **university course registration system (console-based app)** by applying various **OOP design patterns and concepts**. 

## Coursework Group Project

- Replicated STARS, the NTU ``course registration system(console-based)`` using various ``OOP design`` and ``concepts``
- Included features such as registering or dropping courses, swapping course indexes, viewing timetable, alerting class clashes, adding to the wait-list if a certain class is full etc.
- 90% similar to the actual system's functionality except it is console-based for user's input and output.
